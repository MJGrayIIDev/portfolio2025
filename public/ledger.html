        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>In 2017, two private companies held a monopoly on real-time information and notifications for the New York State Legislature. Both of these companies only provided one enterprise level subscription which started out at a minimum of  $500 a month.</p>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>Currently, there is no app in the market that provides native (device) resources at an individual level of subscription cost. Many need to create a de facto stack which consists of numerous apps and third party resources to find and access information.</p>

        
        <h3>Hypthotheis</h3>
        <p>Lobbyist, Union members, and legislative advocates need a resource mobile app that includes everything they’ll need to navigate the New York State Legislature.</p>

        <div>
            <h4>Scope</h4>

            <p>A legislative resources app for the New York State Legislature where users can access foundational legislative information. </p>

            <p>From my competitive analysis, I discovered what services and features are offered in the market. Based on my UX interviews, I also got a sense of what features users are looking for.

                <ol>
                    <li>Account Creation</li>
                    <li>News Access</li>
                    <li>Calendar of Events</li>
                    <li>Legislative Bill Search</li>
                    <li>Push Notifications</li>
                    <li>Directories (Members & Committees)</li>

                </ol>
                
                I articulated 6 main features that will be required in the minimum viable product.</p>

        </div>



        <div>
            <h2>Site Map</h2>

            <p>From the main features I articulated, I created a sitemap with four main features placed in the navigation:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Account Creation</li>
                <li>News Access</li>
                <li>Calendar of Events</li>
                <li>Legislative Bill Search</li>

                <li>Directories (Members & Committees)</li>

        <div>
            <h2>User Flowers</h2>
            <p>Once I successfully completed the user interviews and synthesized the data by way of a user journey map (which drastically helped synthesize the data and create insights), I turned to the user flows. These flows took into account the persona I created along with the feature list previously articulated. I utilized my time spent at the Capitol and in the Legislative Office Building to influence these seamless user flows.</p>


            <h3>User Flow: Share a news artilce</h3>
            <h3>User Flow: View Calendar</h3>

            <p>I created a mid-fidelity wireframe that focused that highlighted the main features I defined earlier in my research. When creating these I took into account the user journey and how the the newly created features could influence a more positive user experience. </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Testing</h2>

            <p>Usability Testing was an exciting experience since various stakeholders were excited to participate and see new innovations coming to the state legislature. The study provided great insights into improvement opportunities to the various features. Seven individuals participated and five prompts were created. The prompts reflected the established user flows and the features outlined. The results are below:</p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users had an 86% competion rate</li>
                    <li>Four users highlighted improvements to the clandar feature(s)</li>
                    <li>All users provided feedback and recommendations beyond the prompts.</li>
                    <li>All users asked how the app would access and collect informartion. </li>
                </ul>

            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Iterations</h2>

        </div>    

        <div>
            <h3>Before</h3>
            <img src="" alt="Ledger Calendar Event Before">

            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>There were several elements of feedback relating to the the detail view of the events. 3 out of 7 participants outlined various groups have events and they'd like to know who organized each event. 5 out of 7 participants commented or directly indicated they'd like to add events to their personal calendar. </p>

            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>I added a host section which featured the host name and contact details along with the number of attendees. To address the addition to the users personal calendar, I added a button icon located at the top right of the view port.</p>

            <h3>After</h3>
            <img src="" alt="Calendar After Photo One">
            <img src="" alt="Calendar After Photo Two">

        <div>
            <h3>Before</h3>
            <img src="" alt="Ledger Legislation Before">

            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>6 out of 7 users indicated that a competitor included some form of annotation or note taking. The first version of the solution did not have the ability to annotate or take notes.</p>

            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>I included the ability to comment on various section of the legislation. Utilizing the anchor from the previous ideated solution above, I included anchor elements so the user can jump to the commented area. </p>

            <h3>After</h3>
            <img src="" alt="Calendar After Legislation One">
            <img src="" alt="Calendar After Legislation Two">

        <div>
            <h3>Before</h3>
            <img src="" alt="Ledger Legislation Before">

            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>Certain bills can have more than 200 pages, which would result in the users constantly scrolling. The initial solution utilized was a text navigation and anchors to jump to various components of the legislation view. This would still require a high amount of scrolling on a small viewport. </p>

            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>I removed the anchors, and kept the fixed text navigation. Rather than jumping to various anchors on one screen, I created a segmented control that showcases the respective component. </p>

            <h3>After</h3>

        <h2>Final Results</h2>
        <h3>Impact of Solution</h3>
        <h4>User Experience Design</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Conduct a second usability test to obtain feedback regarding the newly ideated features - specifically the ability to add comments.</li>
            <li>Create a user flow that allows users to share legislation, notes and comments in one location.</li>
            <li>Create a flow which allows users to indicate their support or opposition to a piece of legislation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Business Development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorporate the NYS Legislative API to gather information</li>
            <li>Work with development to determine the newly incorporated features and how they can be implemented.</li>
            <li>Determine pricing structure: subscription, flat fee, etc.</li>
        </ul>
